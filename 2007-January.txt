Good Day and Season Greetings Gentlemen,

Year has come and gone and I guess because of our professional and personal
commitment not much was done in 2006.
I'm still committed to this effort I would like to see something come out of
it.
The question now is now, should we continue with this project or let it rest
in peace.

Let discuss and hear what everybody thinks.

Dunstan.

Hi,

   I have to admit that the last year was almost null in development  
terms for the digixound project. But this doesn't mean that it's dead  
yet. I continue working in the ustream lib, I have done some progress  
and fixes. I continue thinking that there isn't yet a good open  
source alternative to commercial dj programs as Traktor, VirtualDj,  
MixVibes, Torq, etc.

   I would really want to see a stable (read rock solid) open source  
dj program that can compete with the above ones.

   One of the most used programs used by pro dj's out there is Serato  
Scratch Live, if you look at his features you will see that it's not  
a very advanced program because it's very simple but it's very mature  
and reliable and rock solid (....read no crashes).

   One more time I would like to see a open source dj program running  
on a customized linux operating system.

   A few days ago somebody asked about suggestions for a new dj  
commercial program, my answer was:


"- It's difficult to get a success now because there are a lot of  
competition out there so that they will need to offer some cool/fresh  
program, something different.

- The first thing is to make sure what is the most important weapon  
for a Dj. Effects, VST, Midi, Beat Matching....? The answer is none  
of them. Our first weapon as djs is the music, the songs... in  
another words our song library. This is the most important point. So  
that a new dj program must to have the best music manager out there  
(specially designed for djs). I know that it's boring from a dj  
programmer point of view to develop it but this is the main key.

- The second thing is to have a good sound engine (portable to  
whatever Operating System), solid and stable like a rock. The first  
goal is to be able to mix two songs changing their pitch and with  
some kind of pitch bend support. This sounds very easy but I don't  
know yet a program that does it perfectly.

- The third thing or step is to include a beat matching algorithm.  
Very difficult but is the heart of the modern dj programs.

- The last step is to include the rest of elements: effects, Midi,  
OSC, Time Strecthing, ...and the list goes on. BUT ONLY WHEN THE  
ABOVE POINTS ARE WORKING PERFECTLY!."

   I forgot to add to my answer the magic word "...open source please".

   I'm going to continue with my dream of a powerful open dj program,  
it can take to us some years to reach it but to be honest the time  
doesn't worry me very much.

   Luis.

LSD,

In terms on the ustream lib, can we get a better understanding of where you
are with it.
If it's usable we can start build other things around it

I also have some ideas about songfile/playlist management, I say lets start
discuusing this so we can flesh out a specification/framework to work with.

As for time to work on digixound, I too want to see it done right and I'm
willing to work years on it to achieve this but
I want to see produce something tangible over the next  year.

Dunstan.

Hi,

   In the last months I have fixed some bugs of the ustream lib. I'm  
adding right now a special module to store the properties of all the  
"blocks" in a xml file so that we will be able to store easily custom  
settings and configs (...from the point of view of a end user). I  
think that the ustream lib is now stable. I use it in another program  
that has been tested by some hundreds of users and there aren't  
reports yet of crashes of the ustream kernel, so that I can say that  
I'm happy with it.

   I wrote a long time ago a little program with a rapid development  
tool (c++builder) in a windows platform where I use a customized mad  
decoder like a sink block, the soundtouch library like a filter block  
and the rtaudio library like a sink block. The result was a mini  
program that was able to play mp3 songs within problems and with the  
feature to change his pitch/tempo rate. In conclusion I can say that  
the ustream lib works.

   About playlist management:

   We can compare the songfile/playlist management of dj (...and also  
not dj related) programs and thus we can find the basic features of  
the playlist manager. I have been thinking that it would be nice to  
use some of the open source playlist managers out there to speed up  
the development process (MadMan, Amarok, Juk, Domo, Prokyon, etc).  
One of the main problems of using these open source programs is that  
some of them use a lot of external libraries and this can give us a  
lot of problems. For example Amarok (...in my honest opinion actually  
it's the best music manager) uses the KDE libraries and have not been  
ported yet to windows. So that as Dunstan says we have to decide the  
framework to work with.

   In the last months I have been thinking in develop/use a minimal  
linux distro (...it can be a live/embedded distro as damn small linux  
or puppy linux but more ligthweight) specifically developed for our  
dj program so that we can have more control over it, this can be a  
good discussion point. From one side it's very good to do it but in  
the other side we lose our multi-platform objective. To be honest I'm  
a little bit confused in the last weeks about what is the best way to  
get our target program ready. Definitively we need to discuss more....

   LSD.

Hi all you again!

Nice to see you... Actually I'm really tired from work to be in the mood for 
an answer but I'm on it. Next days I'll write some line...

Only to say I'm reading...

Cheers,

L.S.D,

It's good to hear that you are that far along with ustream. You already have
user base to test stuff?
Is it kontrol-dj stuff or some other program you have in
development/production?

C++Builder.. that's the borland ide right? similar to the kylix environment.

I've never tried any playlist management with any of the program you
mentioned long and hard enough to give an objective answer. What I was
thinking was building something on top of SQLite, it would make
searching,grouping and adding song file attributes much more easier and
faster in realtime than if the the playlist was a flat or xml. Of course
lib/program will be able to export the playlist to a flat file (.m3u, etc)
but lose some attributes or something xml.

As for a demo product, we can always build on top an existing live CD, with
some customizations.
I actually built a live CD for eMixer once,  it detected your soundcard,  I
added sound basic partition detection and mounting, it autogenerated a
playlist and started you in eMixer. It was based on a very small live cd
that started a mame frontend, i can't remember the  name now. I removed the
mame stuff, the total size was about 10Mb
Lately I have been playing around with PuppyLinux and Slax, the USB flash
boot versions. I've not tried Damn Small linux as yet.

PuppyLinux  is easier to customize, you just need to put the stuff you need
in the save file, I have added eMixer, Midnight Commander, the Samba Server,
but i'm still having some problem with smbd. Function keys do not work
properly at the console in PuppyLinux, it makes using  Midnight Commander
and eMixer problematic. I have send that bug to the distrobuilders of Puppy.
Also Puppy does not automount any detected partition, you have to do it
manually from a gui utility :(

Slax looks much cleaner and refined that Puppy. The KDE is very light and
starts fast.
Slax automounts all detected partitions and comes with Midnight Commander
installs. The functions keys work at the console. I don't think it has a
save file like Puppy to save settings and data :( (i need to confirm this).
Slax on USB flash and the Slax Live CD are not quite the same. Mpg321 work
on the live cd but dies when you try to run it from the USB flash distro, (a
bug?... hmm). I've not tried to customized it yet but I can tell with will
be harder than Puppy.

Dunstan.

I'm really glad to know that the ustream base is ok. This is nice.

I suppose that that looking at xmms2 plugins and code can help. Prokyon3 has 
several facilities to use the socket. It can actually connect to Mixxx.

I suppose this is another card in the deck. We have some problems in this. 
Well we have no issues with time: this is ok. I am in peace with the idea of 
a quick and well established software for mixing under Linux... Not possible!
Altough DigiXound needs an important thing... more than other ideas and 
subprojects... It needs organization.
It needs a todo list and a good draft. I know I can help but I don't know what 
to do: I don't know the ustream code, we have not a repository, I don't know 
what you are coding and what I can code now... Organization lacks.
You or Dunstan should write on the wiki a list of tasks, with a cool 
description and basic rules. If the wiki is not enough I can set a 
bugtracking php portal (with bug - task flexible system).
We should use some repository. If svn is shit and cvs too... We can look at 
git (which is nicer and easier)... Or a simple ftp directory for our local 
snapshots.

I think that the Linux distrib should be the last thing to do... Before we 
need to finish the kernel. Please LSD,  make ustream available for us 
somewhere. Then we can start the real group development.

Ciao,
