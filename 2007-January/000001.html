<PRE>Hi,

   I have to admit that the last year was almost null in development  
terms for the digixound project. But this doesn't mean that it's dead  
yet. I continue working in the ustream lib, I have done some progress  
and fixes. I continue thinking that there isn't yet a good open  
source alternative to commercial dj programs as Traktor, VirtualDj,  
MixVibes, Torq, etc.

   I would really want to see a stable (read rock solid) open source  
dj program that can compete with the above ones.

   One of the most used programs used by pro dj's out there is Serato  
Scratch Live, if you look at his features you will see that it's not  
a very advanced program because it's very simple but it's very mature  
and reliable and rock solid (....read no crashes).

   One more time I would like to see a open source dj program running  
on a customized linux operating system.

   A few days ago somebody asked about suggestions for a new dj  
commercial program, my answer was:


&quot;- It's difficult to get a success now because there are a lot of  
competition out there so that they will need to offer some cool/fresh  
program, something different.

- The first thing is to make sure what is the most important weapon  
for a Dj. Effects, VST, Midi, Beat Matching....? The answer is none  
of them. Our first weapon as djs is the music, the songs... in  
another words our song library. This is the most important point. So  
that a new dj program must to have the best music manager out there  
(specially designed for djs). I know that it's boring from a dj  
programmer point of view to develop it but this is the main key.

- The second thing is to have a good sound engine (portable to  
whatever Operating System), solid and stable like a rock. The first  
goal is to be able to mix two songs changing their pitch and with  
some kind of pitch bend support. This sounds very easy but I don't  
know yet a program that does it perfectly.

- The third thing or step is to include a beat matching algorithm.  
Very difficult but is the heart of the modern dj programs.

- The last step is to include the rest of elements: effects, Midi,  
OSC, Time Strecthing, ...and the list goes on. BUT ONLY WHEN THE  
ABOVE POINTS ARE WORKING PERFECTLY!.&quot;

   I forgot to add to my answer the magic word &quot;...open source please&quot;.

   I'm going to continue with my dream of a powerful open dj program,  
it can take to us some years to reach it but to be honest the time  
doesn't worry me very much.

   Luis.
