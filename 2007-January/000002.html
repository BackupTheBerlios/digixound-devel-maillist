<PRE>LSD,

In terms on the ustream lib, can we get a better understanding of where you
are with it.
If it's usable we can start build other things around it

I also have some ideas about songfile/playlist management, I say lets start
discuusing this so we can flesh out a specification/framework to work with.

As for time to work on digixound, I too want to see it done right and I'm
willing to work years on it to achieve this but
I want to see produce something tangible over the next  year.

Dunstan.


   I have to admit that the last year was almost null in development
&gt;<i> terms for the digixound project. But this doesn't mean that it's dead
</I>&gt;<i> yet. I continue working in the ustream lib, I have done some progress
</I>&gt;<i> and fixes. I continue thinking that there isn't yet a good open
</I>&gt;<i> source alternative to commercial dj programs as Traktor, VirtualDj,
</I>&gt;<i> MixVibes, Torq, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I would really want to see a stable (read rock solid) open source
</I>&gt;<i> dj program that can compete with the above ones.
</I>

   One of the most used programs used by pro dj's out there is Serato
&gt;<i> Scratch Live, if you look at his features you will see that it's not
</I>&gt;<i> a very advanced program because it's very simple but it's very mature
</I>&gt;<i> and reliable and rock solid (....read no crashes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    One more time I would like to see a open source dj program running
</I>&gt;<i> on a customized linux operating system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    A few days ago somebody asked about suggestions for a new dj
</I>&gt;<i> commercial program, my answer was:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;- It's difficult to get a success now because there are a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> competition out there so that they will need to offer some cool/fresh
</I>&gt;<i> program, something different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The first thing is to make sure what is the most important weapon
</I>&gt;<i> for a Dj. Effects, VST, Midi, Beat Matching....? The answer is none
</I>&gt;<i> of them. Our first weapon as djs is the music, the songs... in
</I>&gt;<i> another words our song library. This is the most important point. So
</I>&gt;<i> that a new dj program must to have the best music manager out there
</I>&gt;<i> (specially designed for djs). I know that it's boring from a dj
</I>&gt;<i> programmer point of view to develop it but this is the main key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The second thing is to have a good sound engine (portable to
</I>&gt;<i> whatever Operating System), solid and stable like a rock. The first
</I>&gt;<i> goal is to be able to mix two songs changing their pitch and with
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of pitch bend support. This sounds very easy but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> know yet a program that does it perfectly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The third thing or step is to include a beat matching algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i> Very difficult but is the heart of the modern dj programs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The last step is to include the rest of elements: effects, Midi,
</I>&gt;<i> OSC, Time Strecthing, ...and the list goes on. BUT ONLY WHEN THE
</I>&gt;<i> ABOVE POINTS ARE WORKING PERFECTLY!.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I forgot to add to my answer the magic word &quot;...open source please&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I'm going to continue with my dream of a powerful open dj program,
</I>&gt;<i> it can take to us some years to reach it but to be honest the time
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't worry me very much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Luis.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good Day and Season Greetings Gentlemen,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Year has come and gone and I guess because of our professional and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; personal commitment not much was done in 2006.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm still committed to this effort I would like to see something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; come out of it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The question now is now, should we continue with this project or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; let it rest in peace.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let discuss and hear what everybody thinks.
