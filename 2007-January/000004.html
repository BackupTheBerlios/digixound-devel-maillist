<PRE>Hi all you again!

Nice to see you... Actually I'm really tired from work to be in the mood for 
an answer but I'm on it. Next days I'll write some line...

Only to say I'm reading...

Cheers,
J_Zar

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    In the last months I have fixed some bugs of the ustream lib. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> adding right now a special module to store the properties of all the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;blocks&quot; in a xml file so that we will be able to store easily custom
</I>&gt;<i> settings and configs (...from the point of view of a end user). I
</I>&gt;<i> think that the ustream lib is now stable. I use it in another program
</I>&gt;<i> that has been tested by some hundreds of users and there aren't
</I>&gt;<i> reports yet of crashes of the ustream kernel, so that I can say that
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I wrote a long time ago a little program with a rapid development
</I>&gt;<i> tool (c++builder) in a windows platform where I use a customized mad
</I>&gt;<i> decoder like a sink block, the soundtouch library like a filter block
</I>&gt;<i> and the rtaudio library like a sink block. The result was a mini
</I>&gt;<i> program that was able to play mp3 songs within problems and with the
</I>&gt;<i> feature to change his pitch/tempo rate. In conclusion I can say that
</I>&gt;<i> the ustream lib works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    About playlist management:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    We can compare the songfile/playlist management of dj (...and also
</I>&gt;<i> not dj related) programs and thus we can find the basic features of
</I>&gt;<i> the playlist manager. I have been thinking that it would be nice to
</I>&gt;<i> use some of the open source playlist managers out there to speed up
</I>&gt;<i> the development process (MadMan, Amarok, Juk, Domo, Prokyon, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> One of the main problems of using these open source programs is that
</I>&gt;<i> some of them use a lot of external libraries and this can give us a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of problems. For example Amarok (...in my honest opinion actually
</I>&gt;<i> it's the best music manager) uses the KDE libraries and have not been
</I>&gt;<i> ported yet to windows. So that as Dunstan says we have to decide the
</I>&gt;<i> framework to work with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    In the last months I have been thinking in develop/use a minimal
</I>&gt;<i> linux distro (...it can be a live/embedded distro as damn small linux
</I>&gt;<i> or puppy linux but more ligthweight) specifically developed for our
</I>&gt;<i> dj program so that we can have more control over it, this can be a
</I>&gt;<i> good discussion point. From one side it's very good to do it but in
</I>&gt;<i> the other side we lose our multi-platform objective. To be honest I'm
</I>&gt;<i> a little bit confused in the last weeks about what is the best way to
</I>&gt;<i> get our target program ready. Definitively we need to discuss more....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    LSD.
