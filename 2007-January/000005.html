<PRE>L.S.D,

It's good to hear that you are that far along with ustream. You already have
user base to test stuff?
Is it kontrol-dj stuff or some other program you have in
development/production?

C++Builder.. that's the borland ide right? similar to the kylix environment.

I've never tried any playlist management with any of the program you
mentioned long and hard enough to give an objective answer. What I was
thinking was building something on top of SQLite, it would make
searching,grouping and adding song file attributes much more easier and
faster in realtime than if the the playlist was a flat or xml. Of course
lib/program will be able to export the playlist to a flat file (.m3u, etc)
but lose some attributes or something xml.

As for a demo product, we can always build on top an existing live CD, with
some customizations.
I actually built a live CD for eMixer once,  it detected your soundcard,  I
added sound basic partition detection and mounting, it autogenerated a
playlist and started you in eMixer. It was based on a very small live cd
that started a mame frontend, i can't remember the  name now. I removed the
mame stuff, the total size was about 10Mb
Lately I have been playing around with PuppyLinux and Slax, the USB flash
boot versions. I've not tried Damn Small linux as yet.

PuppyLinux  is easier to customize, you just need to put the stuff you need
in the save file, I have added eMixer, Midnight Commander, the Samba Server,
but i'm still having some problem with smbd. Function keys do not work
properly at the console in PuppyLinux, it makes using  Midnight Commander
and eMixer problematic. I have send that bug to the distrobuilders of Puppy.
Also Puppy does not automount any detected partition, you have to do it
manually from a gui utility :(

Slax looks much cleaner and refined that Puppy. The KDE is very light and
starts fast.
Slax automounts all detected partitions and comes with Midnight Commander
installs. The functions keys work at the console. I don't think it has a
save file like Puppy to save settings and data :( (i need to confirm this).
Slax on USB flash and the Slax Live CD are not quite the same. Mpg321 work
on the live cd but dies when you try to run it from the USB flash distro, (a
bug?... hmm). I've not tried to customized it yet but I can tell with will
be harder than Puppy.

Dunstan.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>   In the last months I have fixed some bugs of the ustream lib. I'm adding
</I>&gt;<i> right now a special module to store the properties of all the &quot;blocks&quot; in a
</I>&gt;<i> xml file so that we will be able to store easily custom settings and configs
</I>&gt;<i> (...from the point of view of a end user). I think that the ustream lib is
</I>&gt;<i> now stable. I use it in another program that has been tested by some
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds of users and there aren't reports yet of crashes of the ustream
</I>&gt;<i> kernel, so that I can say that I'm happy with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I wrote a long time ago a little program with a rapid development tool
</I>&gt;<i> (c++builder) in a windows platform where I use a customized mad decoder like
</I>&gt;<i> a sink block, the soundtouch library like a filter block and the rtaudio
</I>&gt;<i> library like a sink block. The result was a mini program that was able to
</I>&gt;<i> play mp3 songs within problems and with the feature to change his
</I>&gt;<i> pitch/tempo rate. In conclusion I can say that the ustream lib works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   About playlist management:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   We can compare the songfile/playlist management of dj (...and also not
</I>&gt;<i> dj related) programs and thus we can find the basic features of the playlist
</I>&gt;<i> manager. I have been thinking that it would be nice to use some of the open
</I>&gt;<i> source playlist managers out there to speed up the development process
</I>&gt;<i> (MadMan, Amarok, Juk, Domo, Prokyon, etc). One of the main problems of using
</I>&gt;<i> these open source programs is that some of them use a lot of external
</I>&gt;<i> libraries and this can give us a lot of problems. For example Amarok (...in
</I>&gt;<i> my honest opinion actually it's the best music manager) uses the KDE
</I>&gt;<i> libraries and have not been ported yet to windows. So that as Dunstan says
</I>&gt;<i> we have to decide the framework to work with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   In the last months I have been thinking in develop/use a minimal linux
</I>&gt;<i> distro (...it can be a live/embedded distro as damn small linux or puppy
</I>&gt;<i> linux but more ligthweight) specifically developed for our dj program so
</I>&gt;<i> that we can have more control over it, this can be a good discussion point.
</I>&gt;<i> From one side it's very good to do it but in the other side we lose our
</I>&gt;<i> multi-platform objective. To be honest I'm a little bit confused in the last
</I>&gt;<i> weeks about what is the best way to get our target program ready.
</I>&gt;<i> Definitively we need to discuss more....

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I have to admit that the last year was almost null in development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; terms for the digixound project. But this doesn't mean that it's dead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yet. I continue working in the ustream lib, I have done some progress
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and fixes. I continue thinking that there isn't yet a good open
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source alternative to commercial dj programs as Traktor, VirtualDj,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MixVibes, Torq, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    I would really want to see a stable (read rock solid) open source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dj program that can compete with the above ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    One of the most used programs used by pro dj's out there is Serato
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Scratch Live, if you look at his features you will see that it's not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a very advanced program because it's very simple but it's very mature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and reliable and rock solid (....read no crashes).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    One more time I would like to see a open source dj program running
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on a customized linux operating system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    A few days ago somebody asked about suggestions for a new dj
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commercial program, my answer was:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;- It's difficult to get a success now because there are a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; competition out there so that they will need to offer some cool/fresh
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; program, something different.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - The first thing is to make sure what is the most important weapon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a Dj. Effects, VST, Midi, Beat Matching....? The answer is none
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of them. Our first weapon as djs is the music, the songs... in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another words our song library. This is the most important point. So
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that a new dj program must to have the best music manager out there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (specially designed for djs). I know that it's boring from a dj
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programmer point of view to develop it but this is the main key.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - The second thing is to have a good sound engine (portable to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever Operating System), solid and stable like a rock. The first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; goal is to be able to mix two songs changing their pitch and with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some kind of pitch bend support. This sounds very easy but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know yet a program that does it perfectly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - The third thing or step is to include a beat matching algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Very difficult but is the heart of the modern dj programs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - The last step is to include the rest of elements: effects, Midi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OSC, Time Strecthing, ...and the list goes on. BUT ONLY WHEN THE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ABOVE POINTS ARE WORKING PERFECTLY!.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    I forgot to add to my answer the magic word &quot;...open source please&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    I'm going to continue with my dream of a powerful open dj program,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it can take to us some years to reach it but to be honest the time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't worry me very much.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
