<PRE>So here I am ...

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    In the last months I have fixed some bugs of the ustream lib. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> adding right now a special module to store the properties of all the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;blocks&quot; in a xml file so that we will be able to store easily custom
</I>&gt;<i> settings and configs (...from the point of view of a end user). I
</I>&gt;<i> think that the ustream lib is now stable. I use it in another program
</I>&gt;<i> that has been tested by some hundreds of users and there aren't
</I>&gt;<i> reports yet of crashes of the ustream kernel, so that I can say that
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I wrote a long time ago a little program with a rapid development
</I>&gt;<i> tool (c++builder) in a windows platform where I use a customized mad
</I>&gt;<i> decoder like a sink block, the soundtouch library like a filter block
</I>&gt;<i> and the rtaudio library like a sink block. The result was a mini
</I>&gt;<i> program that was able to play mp3 songs within problems and with the
</I>&gt;<i> feature to change his pitch/tempo rate. In conclusion I can say that
</I>&gt;<i> the ustream lib works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I'm really glad to know that the ustream base is ok. This is nice.


&gt;<i>    About playlist management:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    We can compare the songfile/playlist management of dj (...and also
</I>&gt;<i> not dj related) programs and thus we can find the basic features of
</I>&gt;<i> the playlist manager. I have been thinking that it would be nice to
</I>&gt;<i> use some of the open source playlist managers out there to speed up
</I>&gt;<i> the development process (MadMan, Amarok, Juk, Domo, Prokyon, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> One of the main problems of using these open source programs is that
</I>&gt;<i> some of them use a lot of external libraries and this can give us a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of problems. For example Amarok (...in my honest opinion actually
</I>&gt;<i> it's the best music manager) uses the KDE libraries and have not been
</I>&gt;<i> ported yet to windows. So that as Dunstan says we have to decide the
</I>&gt;<i> framework to work with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I suppose that that looking at xmms2 plugins and code can help. Prokyon3 has 
several facilities to use the socket. It can actually connect to Mixxx.


&gt;<i>    In the last months I have been thinking in develop/use a minimal
</I>&gt;<i> linux distro (...it can be a live/embedded distro as damn small linux
</I>&gt;<i> or puppy linux but more ligthweight) specifically developed for our
</I>&gt;<i> dj program so that we can have more control over it, this can be a
</I>&gt;<i> good discussion point. From one side it's very good to do it but in
</I>&gt;<i> the other side we lose our multi-platform objective. To be honest I'm
</I>&gt;<i> a little bit confused in the last weeks about what is the best way to
</I>&gt;<i> get our target program ready. Definitively we need to discuss more....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I suppose this is another card in the deck. We have some problems in this. 
Well we have no issues with time: this is ok. I am in peace with the idea of 
a quick and well established software for mixing under Linux... Not possible!
Altough DigiXound needs an important thing... more than other ideas and 
subprojects... It needs organization.
It needs a todo list and a good draft. I know I can help but I don't know what 
to do: I don't know the ustream code, we have not a repository, I don't know 
what you are coding and what I can code now... Organization lacks.
You or Dunstan should write on the wiki a list of tasks, with a cool 
description and basic rules. If the wiki is not enough I can set a 
bugtracking php portal (with bug - task flexible system).
We should use some repository. If svn is shit and cvs too... We can look at 
git (which is nicer and easier)... Or a simple ftp directory for our local 
snapshots.

I think that the Linux distrib should be the last thing to do... Before we 
need to finish the kernel. Please LSD,  make ustream available for us 
somewhere. Then we can start the real group development.

Ciao,
J_Zar
